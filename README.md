- Created new columns in Excel to support analysis:
  - **Month & Day** from `order_date` using:
  ```excel
  =TEXT(order_date, "mmmm")
  =TEXT(order_date, "dddd")
  ```
  - Hour from `order_time` using:
  ```excel
  =HOUR([@[order_time]])
  ```

  ```excel
  =CHOOSE(MONTH(order_date),
  "Winter", "Winter", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring",
  "Summer", "Summer", "Summer",
  "Fall", "Fall", "Fall", "Winter")
  ```
  - Pizza Size Labels mapped from codes (S, M, L, XL, XXL) using:
